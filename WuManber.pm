=head1 NAME

Search::WuManber -- A fast algorithm for multi-pattern searching

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Search::WuManber;

  my $search = Search::WuManber->new([qw(tribute reserved serve distribute)]);
  my @matches = $search->all(  lc "All rights reserved. Distribute freely.");
  my $match =   $search->first(lc "All rights reserved. Distribute freely.");
  $match = $search->next();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the Wu-Manber multi-pattern parallel search algorithm.

The search strings passed to C<new()> are prepared for parallel lookup.
A perl reference pointing to all internal data is returned. Treat this reference
as opaque. C<first()> and C<next()> iterate over all text positions where matches occur.
Each match is returned as a reference to a two-element array representing text
offset and list index of a search string. Options for C<new()>:
 * C<<return_string => 1>> make the return value of the iterator a 
three-element array, containing also the search string itself.
 * C<<case_sensitive => 0>> run the search case insensitive (slightly slower).

The matches are returned roughly sorted. Offset usually increments, but may
jump backwards by the length difference of neighbouring search strings. 

C<New()> allocates a constant amount of memory (between 130k and 2MB).
This memory can be returned by C<undef $search;>



=head1 BUGS

The iterator is inefficient. C<first()> just calls C<all()> ..., 

This implementation uses internal hash-functions, which may not be optimal. 

Efficiency of the WuManber depends on the minimum length of search strings.
Suggested minimum length is 5. C<new()> switches to a slower algorithm if one of 
the strings has less than 3 characters.

Changes in the list of search patterns are not seen by the search algorithm after
C<new()> was called. Changes in the text are undefined. Call C<first()> to restart with 
a new text.
